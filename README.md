<details>
  <summary>Developed And Designed By <strong><u>Pralin Khaira</u></strong></summary>
  
  - This project focuses on an Instagram password cracker designed for educational purposes and security awareness.

</details>



## Description

- Insta-Cypher is a Bash script designed for ethical purposes to perform brute-force attacks on Instagram accounts, allowing users to recover forgotten or lost passwords. This script utilizes a list of possible passwords and various techniques to attempt to gain access to an Instagram account. Please ensure you have explicit permission to use this tool on any account.
- If you want any help regarding this, you need to **_STAR_** the repository first.

## Disclaimer

This script is provided for educational and ethical purposes only. Misuse of this script for unauthorized access to Instagram accounts is illegal and unethical. By using this script, you agree that, I (Pralin Khaira) am not responsible for any illegal or unauthorized use. Use this tool responsibly and only on accounts for which you have explicit permission.

## Features

- Brute force attack on Instagram accounts.
- Session saving for resuming an interrupted attack.
- Multi-threading support for faster password cracking.
- Utilizes Tor for anonymous and secure connections.

## **Note:** 
- Instagram has enhanced its security for repeated incorrect brute forced password attempts, causing the script to become outdated.
- I currently don't have an estimated time for an update, so please refrain from commenting "fake" in the issue section.
- Even don't spam my socials or my mail inox regarding personal help you need, consider this as my part time project, I have my private life too :)

## Update
Thank you to user [RedDragon-MuKeYu](https://github.com/RedDragon-MuKeYu) for identifying an issue with the password list file name. When using the default password list, ensure it is named "default-passwords.lst" instead of "passwords.lst." This correction ensures that the script can read the password list correctly. If you encounter any further issues, please feel free to reach out for assistance. Your feedback is valuable in improving the script for all users.
